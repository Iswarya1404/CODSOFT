                <li>The Legend whom I admire the most as a Sportsman,as a leader,as a human-being is none other than our former Indian Cricket team Captain " Mahendra Singh Dhoni " </li> 
                <li>He is widely Considered as one of the greatest captains,wicket-keeper batsman and finishers in the Cricket history.</li>
                <li>He served as a captain from 2007-2017 in International Cricket and in Test-Cricket from 2008-2014.</li>
                <li>He is the first cricketer to be a winning captain of all forms of Cricket.</li>
                <li>One of the things that I admire mostly about him is his ideology and way of problem tackling.</li>
                <li>He was given a name "CAPTAIN COOL" as he stays calm in every situation.Every individual must learn this nature of maintaing their cool and handling the situation with ease.</li>
                <li>The another most admirable quality is his team-management skill.He makes sure each player of his team is good in spirits and boosts them up which is the main reason for his and the team's success.</li>
                <li>I dedicate this web page as a tribute to Sir M.S. Dhoni, as a reflection of my deep admiration for him.</li>
